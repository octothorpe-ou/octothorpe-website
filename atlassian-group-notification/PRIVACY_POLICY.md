## 2. About the App

Group Notification is a Forge application that enables users to @mention all members of a group at once by creating a comment on Confluence pages or Jira issues, effectively providing group notification functionality that Atlassian doesn't offer natively. The App runs entirely on Atlassian's Forge platform and does not operate any external servers or infrastructure.

---

## 3. Data We Access

To provide its functionality, the App accesses the following data through Atlassian's official APIs:

| Data Type | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Group names and IDs** | To display available groups for selection |
| **Group member lists** | To generate @mentions for all members of a selected group |
| **User display names** | To show member previews before generating mentions |
| **User account IDs** | To create properly formatted @mention references |

### What We Do NOT Collect
- We do not collect or store any personal data
- We do not track user behavior or analytics
- We do not use cookies or similar tracking technologies
- We do not access content of your Confluence pages or Jira issues beyond what is necessary for the App's core functionality

---

## 4. Data Storage and Processing

### Forge Platform
The App runs entirely on Atlassian's Forge platform, which means:

- **No external servers:** All processing occurs within Atlassian's infrastructure
- **No data export:** Data does not leave Atlassian's environment
- **No persistent storage:** The App does not store personal data; it only retrieves data from Atlassian's APIs when you actively use the App

### Data Residency
Because the App runs on Atlassian's Forge platform without external data egress, your data remains within Atlassian's infrastructure and is subject to Atlassian's data residency policies. For more information, see [Atlassian's Data Residency documentation](https://www.atlassian.com/trust/privacy/data-residency).

---

## 5. Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, rent, or otherwise disclose your data to any third parties.

The only data processing that occurs is:
- Reading group and user information from Atlassian's APIs
- Displaying that information within the App's user interface
- Generating @mention markup that you choose to insert into your content

---

## 6. Data Security

Security is maintained through the following measures:

- **Atlassian Forge Platform:** The App leverages Atlassian's enterprise-grade security infrastructure
- **No external transmission:** Data never leaves Atlassian's secure environment
- **API-only access:** The App only accesses data through Atlassian's authenticated and authorized APIs
- **Permission-based:** The App only accesses data that Atlassian's permission system allows based on the current user's access rights

## 7. Your Rights Under GDPR

As an Estonian company operating within the European Union, we comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). You have the following rights:

### Right to Access
You may request information about what data we process about you. Since we do not store any personal data, there is no personal data held by us to provide.

### Right to Rectification
Since we do not store personal data, there is no data to correct. Any data displayed by the App comes directly from your Atlassian instance and should be corrected there.

### Right to Erasure ("Right to be Forgotten")
Since we do not store personal data, there is no data to delete. Uninstalling the App will immediately cease all data access.

### Right to Data Portability
Since we do not store personal data, there is no data to export.

### Right to Object
You may stop the App from accessing your data at any time by uninstalling it from your Atlassian instance.

### Right to Lodge a Complaint
If you believe your data protection rights have been violated, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. In Estonia, this is the Data Protection Inspectorate (Andmekaitse Inspektsioon): https://www.aki.ee/en

## 8. Legal Basis for Processing

Under GDPR Article 6, we process data based on:

- **Legitimate Interest (Article 6(1)(f)):** Processing is necessary for the App to provide its core functionality of generating group notifications, which users explicitly request when using the App.
- **Contract Performance (Article 6(1)(b)):** Processing is necessary to fulfill the service you have requested by installing and using the App.

---

## 9. Data Retention

We do not retain any personal data. Data is accessed in real-time from Atlassian's APIs only when you actively use the App and is not stored after the operation completes.

---

## 10. Children's Privacy

The App is designed for business use within Atlassian's enterprise products. We do not knowingly collect or process data from children under the age of 16.

---

## 11. Third-Party Services

The App does not integrate with any third-party services. All functionality is provided through Atlassian's Forge platform and official APIs.

---

## 12. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for legal, operational, or regulatory reasons.

When we make changes:
- We will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy
- For significant changes, we will provide notice through the Atlassian Marketplace listing

We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your information.
